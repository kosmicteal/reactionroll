## About

Have you ever had a character that has such a high level you no longer remember all their actions? Maybe it has been more than 2 years since you initially did their character sheet.

This problem can now be solved easily! With reActionroll, you can now easily do a summary of your sheet that you can print next to you as a helper. You can also save it for future modifications if needed!

I am currently taking this as a hobby project so updates might come randomly from time to time. Feel free to report any bug or suggestion on its Github repository and I will tackle them when time allows me to do so.

This page has been done with React, Redux and other Open Source technologies. Detailed information about this project can be found on the About page.
